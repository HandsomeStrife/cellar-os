## [Unreleased]

### Catalogue UX overhaul — 2026-06-29

A focused pass over the catalogue (browse/filter/price) driven by the trade
bug list, plus the first stage of case‑vs‑unit pricing. Shipped to `main`;
328+ Pest tests green throughout.

#### Added — full‑featured catalogue filters (Phase 1) · `2ef024e`
- A collapsible **"Filters" panel** (Alpine) covering every filterable column:
  **region, sub‑region, producer, grape, price range (min/max) and vintage
  range (min/max)**, on top of the existing search / colour / supplier.
- **Cascading dropdowns**: changing country clears region + sub‑region;
  changing region clears sub‑region. An active‑filter **count badge** on the
  toggle and a **Clear filters** action.
- `ProductRepository::search()` extended with the new criteria; new
  `regions()` / `subRegions()` distinct‑value helpers that cascade by the
  broader selection; `SORTABLE` now includes region/sub‑region.
- Richer table cells: **sub‑region** added to Origin, **price‑per‑litre** shown
  under price.
- Migration `2026_06_29_120000_add_catalogue_filter_indexes` indexes
  region/sub_region/producer/vintage/unit_price to keep the panel fast across
  the ~12k‑row catalogue.
- Acceptance case "a white wine from Burgundy under £20" works and is
  test‑covered (`ProductFilterTest`, `BrowseCatalogueTest`).
- _Known ceiling:_ region/producer are only ~89% / ~74% populated, so those
  filters structurally miss wines with empty columns (same authoritative‑only
  limit as `wine:backfill-attributes`).

#### Fixed — `case_size` pack-string parsing + Flint catalogue correction (Phase 2d) · `65125f5`
- **Root cause**: Flint Wines' "Case Size" column holds pack descriptors like
  `12x75cl`; `NormaliseService::parseInt` digit-stripped them to `1275`
  (`6x75cl`→675, `3x150cl`→3150). The catalogue's Format column rendered
  "750ml · 1275/case"; with case pricing live it would also corrupt pack maths.
  2,991 active priced wines were affected (~24% of the catalogue), and since
  the rows rode golden, prod had the same garbage.
- **Parser fix**: `NormaliseService` now parses `N x SIZE[unit]` into both the
  case quantity AND the bottle size — `12x75cl` → case 12 × 750ml, `3x150cl` →
  case 3 × 1500ml (magnums), `12x37.5cl` → case 12 × 375ml (halves). An explicit
  bottle-size column still wins; a plain numeric case size is unchanged.
- **Data correction**: re-parsed Flint's two on-disk tabular sources
  (inventory + broking) with hand-set column mappings (the model was
  rate-limited; the headers were unambiguous), committing via the idempotent
  upsert. Flint's lists carry separate per-bottle and per-case prices, so the
  corrected rows are now `sold_by=case` with `pack_price` populated — a
  real-data proof of Phases 2a–2c. Result: **2,864 → 0** garbage rows; 3,960
  Flint wines correctly case-priced; 268 orphaned magnum/half rows archived.
- _Deferred_: Eurowines (125 wines, a PDF that needs LLM extraction) and two
  single stragglers — to be re-parsed once the API limit resets.

#### Added — case vs unit pricing, order & basket by the case (Phase 2c) · `33494fa`
- Completes the case‑pricing loop end to end. `order_items` gains
  `sold_by_at_order` / `pack_size_at_order` / `pack_price_at_order` (a
  snapshot of how the wine was sold), while **`quantity_units` stays the
  canonical bottle count** — so receive → inventory is unchanged (a 2‑case
  order receives 12 bottles).
- `OrderItemData` gains pure display helpers — `soldByCaseAtOrder()`,
  `casesAtOrder()`, `looseBottlesAtOrder()`, `casePriceAtOrder()`,
  `lineTotal()`.
- **Catalogue basket**: case‑sold wines basket and step a case at a time;
  `setBasketCases()` edits by the case; the basket shows `£x/case (6 btl)` +
  a cases input. Checkout snapshots the framing.
- **Manual order create**: `addLine` steps by case for case wines;
  `setLineCases()` edits by the case; the order view modal + PDF render
  "2 cases (12 btl) · £x/case".

#### Added — case vs unit pricing, parser detection + review (Phase 2b) · `f45e8c4`
- New `Domain\Supplier\Enums\ParsedWineFlag` formalises the review‑flag
  vocabulary (stable string values) and adds **`ambiguous_pricing`** ("Check
  case vs bottle"), with a badge label/colour. `DocumentAnalysisService::vet()`
  now raises it when a per‑bottle row's own text hints at case pricing
  (conservative — `/case`, `per case`, `x6`/`x12`, `6x75`; not a bare "case").
- `NormaliseService` reconciles pricing into the canonical per‑bottle
  `unit_price`: it reads a `price_basis` (bottle|case) field and/or a
  `pack_price` column, and when sold by the case derives the per‑bottle price
  from case price ÷ `case_size` (or keeps a separately‑quoted bottle price).
- `ClaudeClient`: `price_basis` + `pack_price` added to the shared `FIELDS`;
  the tabular‑mapping and PDF‑extraction prompts now explain per‑case pricing,
  including lists that mix both per row. _Schema/prompt changes are exercised
  via the fake client only — live‑extraction validation against real
  case‑priced lists is deferred (it costs API spend)._
- Review screen (`DocumentReview`): inline **Sold by / Bottles per case /
  Price per case** controls; the flag badge renders via the enum; case‑sold
  rows show `£x/case · £y/btl`. `RefineParseProfileAction` folds the case
  fields into the learned recipe examples.

#### Added — case vs unit pricing, model + display (Phase 2a) · `70577f2`
- New `Domain\Catalogue\Enums\SellingUnit` (`bottle` | `case`).
- Migration `2026_06_29_130000_add_selling_unit_to_products` adds
  `products.sold_by` (default `bottle`) and `products.pack_price` (the
  supplier's exact quoted case price; null = derive from `unit_price` ×
  `case_size`). **`unit_price` remains the canonical per‑bottle price**, so
  cross‑supplier sort / filter / comparison are unaffected.
- `ProductData` carries the new fields plus pure display helpers —
  `soldByCase()`, `displayPrice()` (native selling unit; exact pack price
  preferred over the derived one), `perBottleEquivalent()`.
- Catalogue price cell now shows e.g. **`£1,275 /case`** with
  **`≈ £212.50 / btl`** underneath; bottle‑sold wines are unchanged.
- Threaded through the whole write path: `UpsertProductAction`, golden
  export/import (`ExportGoldenSnapshot` + `ImportCatalogueWinesAction`, which
  also backs `/api/ingest/wines`), `ProductFactory` (+ a `soldByCase()`
  state). `NormaliseService` defaults to `bottle` for now — per‑row detection
  is Phase 2b.
- `sold_by` / `pack_price` are deliberately **not** wine facts (kept out of
  `ContributeWineFactsAction`; the facts store is price‑free by policy).

#### Changed — catalogue polish & perceived speed (Phase 0) · `2ef024e`
- **Removed the "Stock" column** from the catalogue table — it surfaced raw
  supplier‑provided `products.stock`, easily confused with venue inventory.
  The column stays in the DB; it is dropped from the table and from
  `ProductRepository::SORTABLE`.
- **Cursor & hover affordances**: a global rule gives every actionable element
  a `pointer` cursor (and disabled controls `not-allowed`), so buttons, sort
  headers and icon actions read as clickable.
- **Livewire perceived‑speed fixes**: a loading veil dims the table on any
  filter/sort/paginate request, and `wire:loading` guards disable
  add‑to‑basket (icon swaps to a spinner), delete and save‑price to stop
  double‑clicks. New `loader-circle` and `sliders-horizontal` Lucide icons.

#### Notes
- All work committed directly to `main` and pushed to
  `github.com:HandsomeStrife/cellar-os`.
- Remaining case‑vs‑unit work is tracked on the board: **2b** parser detection
  (per‑row per‑case vs per‑bottle), **2c** basket/orders by the case
  (+ receive→inventory conversion), **2d** audit & fix already‑live mis‑priced
  wines (the Alabaster / Stodden / `1275/case` spot checks). A separate backend
  redesign track (light‑mode default → dashboard → full pages + sidenav) is
  also queued.
